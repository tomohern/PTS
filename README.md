Auto Setup for Profit Trailer software on Ubuntu. Probably works on other \*nix distros but I have not tested.

Step 1 - copy and paste this to your command line:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomohern/PTS/scripts/setup

This script will update and install needed software, create a non-root user on the server, and download addtional scripts, and then log you into your new use account.

Step 2 - Type:

chmod +x setup
./setup
